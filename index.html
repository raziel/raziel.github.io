<h1>Raziel Alvarez</h1>
<p>Hi.</p>

<p>
I’m a pragmatic engineer in constant search for the balance between beautiful, universal solutions and impact in the real world.
</p>

<p>
Today I do this as part of the <logo>PyTorch team at Facebook, developing a machine learning framework that powers state of the art research, and helps bring that research to products across an ever increasing number of fields.
</p>
<p>
Previously, I spent 8 years at Google where I spent a good part of that time also building machine learning frameworks (like <logo>TensorFlow), and doing a bit of research with direct impact in Google’s products (like <logo>Hey Google).
Oh, and my first few months I worked on the Fonts project that I use on this site.
</p>

<p>
For more details on my Google projects browse here.
</p>

<p>
Prior to that I spent 7 years at Appian, where I lead a number of projects but most significantly co-authored the SAIL (Self-Assembling Interface Layer) technology which underpins the company’s low-code platform.
